# *Variance*

- Variance is a descriptive statistic that describes how spread out the points in a data set are.

---

# *Variance in Numpy*

```
import numpy as np

grades = [88, 82, 85, 84, 90]
mean = np.mean(grades)

#When calculating these variables, square the difference.
difference_one = (88 - mean)**2
difference_two = (82 - mean)**2
difference_three = (85 - mean)**2
difference_four = (84 - mean)**2
difference_five = (90 - mean)**2

difference_sum = difference_one + difference_two + difference_three + difference_four + difference_five

variance = difference_sum / 5

print("The sum of the squared differences is " + str(difference_sum))
print("The variance is " + str(variance))
```

- Letâ€™s dissect this block of code:
    - Variance is usually represented by the symbol sigma squared.
    - We start by taking every point in the dataset â€” from point numberÂ `1`Â to point numberÂ `N`Â â€” and finding the difference between that point and the mean.
    - Next, we square each difference to make all differences positive.
    - Finally, we average those squared differences by adding them together and dividing byÂ `N`, the total number of points in the dataset.
- All of this work can be done quickly using Pythonâ€™s NumPy library.

```sql
import numpy as np
 
dataset = [3, 5, -2, 49, 10]
variance = np.var(dataset)
```

---

# *Standard Deviation*

- Standard deviation is computed by taking the square root of the variance.
- In Python, you can take the square root of a number usingÂ `** 0.5`:

```sql
num = 25
num_square_root = num ** 0.5
```

```sql
import numpy as np
 
dataset = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
standard_deviation = np.std()
```

- By finding the number of standard deviations a data point is away from the mean, we can begin to investigate how unusual that datapoint truly is.
- In fact, we can usually expect:
    - Around **68%** of your data to fall within one standard deviation of the mean.
    - **95%** of your data to fall within two standard deviations of the mean.
    - **99.7%** of your data to fall within three standard deviations of the mean.
