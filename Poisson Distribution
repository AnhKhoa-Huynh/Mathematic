# Poisson Distribution

# *INTRODUCTION*

- The Poisson distribution is another common distribution, and it is used to describe the number of times a certain event occurs within a fixed time or space interval.
- For example, the Poisson distribution can be used to describe the number of cars that pass through a specific intersection between 4pm and 5pm on a given day. It can also be used to describe the number of calls received in an office between 1pm to 3pm on a certain day.
- The Poisson distribution is defined by the rate parameter, symbolized by the Greek letter lambda, λ.
- Lambda represents the expected value — or the average value — of the distribution. For example, if our expected number of customers between 1pm and 2pm is 7, then we would set the parameter for the Poisson distribution to be 7.

****Calculating Probabilities of Exact Values Using the Probability Mass Function****

# *CALCULATING PROBABILITIES OF EXACT VALUES USING THE PROBABILITY MASS FUNCTION* poisson.pmf()

- We can use the `poisson.pmf()` method in the `scipy.stats` library to ***evaluate the probability of observing a specific number given the parameter*** (expected value) of a distribution.
- The number of times it rains in the next 30 days is “Poisson distributed” with lambda = 10.
- We can calculate the probability of exactly 6 times of rain as follows:

- If we expect it to rain 10 times in the next 30 days, the number of times it rains in the next 30 days is “Poisson distributed” with lambda = 10.
- We can calculate the probability of 12-14 times of rain as follows:
