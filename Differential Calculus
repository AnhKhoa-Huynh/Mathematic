# *Limits*

- Limits quantify what happens to the values of a function as we approach a given point.
- This can be defined as: “***the limit as x goes to 6 of f(x) approaches some value L***”.

- We can read this as: “***the limit as x goes to 6 of f(x) approaches some value L***”
    - To evaluate this limit, we take points increasingly closer and closer to *6*— as close to 6 as we can get, but not 6 itself! We then evaluate where the function is headed at those points.
- If we look at the limit of a function as x approaches a value from one direction, this is called ***a one-sided limit***.
- For example, we might look at the values of *f(5)*, *f(5.9)*, *f(5.999)* and see if they are trending towards the value of *f(6)*. This is represented as:

- We read this as “***the limit as x approaches 6 from the left side approaches some value L***”.
- Whereas if we looked at the values of *f(6.1)*, *f(6.01)*, *f(6.0005)* and see if they are trending towards *f(6)*, we would represent this as:

- We read this as “***the limit as x goes to 6 from the right side approaches some value L***”.

> The limit as *x* approaches 6 exists only if the limit as *x* approaches 6 from the left side is equal to the limit as *x* approaches 6 from the right side.

# *Limit Definition of a Derivative*

- Suppose we wanted to measure a runner’s instantaneous speed using a stopwatch. By instantaneous speed, we mean their speed at an exact moment in time.
- Let’s define *f(t)* as the runner’s distance from the start time at time *t*. How could we find the runner’s instantaneous speed at 1 second after the race? We could record their positions at 1 second and sometime second measurement. Then the second time is *x+h*, and the positions at the two times are *f(x)* and *f(x+h)*.

> This is called the *derivative at a point*, which is the function’s slope (rate of change) at a specific point.

# *The Derivative Function*

- Derivative functions are often denoted ***f’(x)* (read *f* prime of *x*)** or ***df/dx* (read derivative of *f* at *x*)**.
- If ***f(x)*** represents ***the function value at a point x***, the corresponding ***derivative function f’(x)*** represents ***how a function is changing at the same point x***.

---

# *Properties of the Derivative Function*

- Let’s say:
    - If *f(t)* describes a runner’s position as a function of time; Then, the derivative function *f’(t)* describes the runner’s speed at any time *t*.
    - If *s(t)* that describes the real-time sales of a particular product; the corresponding derivative function *s’(t)* describes how those sales are changing in real-time.
- If ***f’(x)* > 0**, the corresponding function *f(x)* is increasing. Keep in mind that *f(x)* itself may be negative even though the derivative *f’(x)* is positive. The derivative says nothing about the value of the original function, only about how it is changing. Similarly, if *f’(x)* < 0, then the original function is decreasing.
- If ***f’(x)* = 0**, then the function is not changing. This can mean one of a few things.
    - It may mean that the function has reached a ***local maximum* (or maxima)**. A local maximum is a value of x where *f’(x)* changes from positive to negative and thus hits 0 along the way. In *f(x)*, the local maximum is higher than all the points around it.
    - It may also mean that the function has reached what is called a ***local minimum***. A local minimum is lower than the points around it. When *f’(x)* goes from negative values to 0 to positive values, a local minimum form.
    - It may be an *inflection point*. This is a point where a function has a change in the direction of curvature. For example, the curve of the function goes from “facing down” to “facing up.” Finding inflection points involves a second derivative test, which we will not get to in this lesson.
- *Global maxima* and *global minima* are the largest or smallest over the entire range of a function.
- In machine learning models, maxima and minima are key concepts as they’re usually what we are trying to find when we optimize!

- What do we know about the value of *f’(x)* in this section of *f(x) in the above 5 images, respectively?*
    1. *f'(x) > 0* because the slope of the function is positive.
    2. *f'(x) = 0* because the slope of the function is going from positive to negative and at the global maximum it is equal to zero.
    3. *f'(x) < 0* because the slope of the function is negative.
    4. *f'(x) = 0* because the slope of the function is going from negative to positive and at the local minimum it is equal to zero.
    5. *f'(x) = 0* because the slope of the function is going from positive to negative and at the local maximum it is equal to zero.

# *Calculating Derivatives*

- We can think that derivatives are *linear operators*, fancy language that means:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e6527334-52df-4076-b716-7e9934edb9dd/Untitled.png)

- This means that we can pull constants out when calculating a derivative. For example, say we have the following function:
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/48c7ad86-638b-4e2c-aebe-fe9d4630afd0/Untitled.png)
    
- We can define the derivative as the following:
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2fc39466-061f-43f8-8b0f-08620812ca79/Untitled.png)
    

> Breaking it down further:
> 
> - (d/dx)4x^2 means we are taking the derivative of 4x^2 with respect to x.
> - Applying the **power rule** of derivatives, we multiply the coefficient (4) by the exponent (2) and reduce the exponent by 1, resulting in 8x.
> - Therefore, (d/dx)4x^2 = 8x.
- We can also say that:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/069d6e41-02e7-4067-9dcb-c842f30e28b7/Untitled.png)

> **This means that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.**
> 
- For example, say we have the following function:
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/829ec60d-2fc7-4bb3-8b2d-7b56c92b9458/Untitled.png)
    
- We can define the derivative as the following:
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/ecf270fa-a3e4-4fd8-a4f4-818201149f71/Untitled.png)
    

> **When products get involved, derivatives can get a bit more complicated.**
> 
- For example, let’s say we have a function in the following form of two separate “parts”:
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/55cd2598-e6e6-4afb-ae19-090656b6ce51/Untitled.png)
    
- We define the *product rule* as:
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/ea8c8e5b-79cb-4152-87bd-fe20199936f2/Untitled.png)
    

<aside>
💡 Mnemonically, we remember this as “**first times derivative of second plus second times derivative of first”**.

</aside>

- For example:
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b6fbc783-3ffc-4ddf-a22c-002f2fbdaeeb/Untitled.png)
    
- We would use the product rule as:
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/30eb0ba3-ff82-489b-9816-6ffea90866d5/Untitled.png)
    

> **Finally, one last rule to take with us into the next exercise is that the derivative of a constant is equal to 0.**
>

- This is because for a constant there is never any change in value, so the derivative will always equal zero. For example, we can say:

# *More on Calculating Derivatives*

- There are rules even beyond the power rule. Many common functions have defined derivatives.

# *Calculating Derivatives in Python*

- For example:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/047615dd-630f-4bd0-8cb8-482cee761aef/Untitled.png)

```sql
from math import pow
# dx is the "step" between each x value
dx = 0.05 # The value 0.05 is an arbitrary choice in this case, but it determines the density or spacing of the x values in the array.
def f(x):
  # to calculate the y values of the function
  return pow(x, 2) + 3
# x values
f_array_x = [x for x in np.arange(0,4,dx)]
# y values
f_array_y = [f(x) for x in np.arange(0,4,dx)] # store the corresponding y values by applying the function f(x) to each x value in f_array_x
```

- The `pow()` function within the `f(x)` function we defined allows us to calculate the values of *x^2*
- To compute the derivative of `f_array`, we use a NumPy function called `gradient()`.

```sql
f_array_deriv = np.gradient(f_array_y, dx)
```

- `gradient()` takes in an array (in this case, a one-dimensional array) as its first argument. We also need to specify the distance between the *x* values, which is `dx`.
- We want “Change in x” to be as small as possible, so we get an accurate instantaneous rate of change for each point.
- Another example:
